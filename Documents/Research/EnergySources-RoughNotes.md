Look at various costs associated with consumer installation, maybe less relevant to large scale budgets and industrial costs.

Deep breakdown of offshore wind in the UK, not much specific information of costs but lots of detail on past investments made for different wind farms, maintanence requirements, etc.

Breakdows costs of many different future investments of different sources at scale. Doesn't give an upfront price, instead considers 'levelised cost' - 'the average cost of the lifetime of the plant per MWh of electricity generated'. This is effectively the metric we want to be using to evaluate a location, however as we want to consider different locations to evaluate best decisions this source will not help with that cost consideration as it only includes specific project funding in set locations.

## Power Sources:

### Solar PV

2019 Commercial cost USD/kW in the UK $1657/kW (~£1210) and $2566/kW (~£1875) for residential installations. [2] Considering this project is attempting to allocate across the country the scale will fall well within the commercial range.
Comparing with UK Gov data from the 2018-19 year small scale Solar installations of <4kW cells this backs up the claim £1816 [1]~ equivalent to the $2566 cost estimated in report[2]. 
Uk goverment data[1] also suggests that installations up to 50kW would cost an average £1139, and a mean cost of £1088/kW in 2021. Although a slight discrepancy between the two sources of ~£60-70/kW the general consistency of prices would suggest that it would be a appropriate to use a value of **£1088/kW** for installing, connecting and purchasing solar PV equipment in current year unless contradicted by another reliable source.

### Onshore Wind

### Offshore Wind

### Geothermal?
