Welcome to my presentation on my investigation into efficiently allocating renewable energy sources across the UK.

So what are the problems we're attempting to solve in this project?

Well, in todays world, due to the threat of climate change there is ever more demand for renewable energy. However the majority of renewable energy sources are reliant on the weather for their output, introducing an inherent uncertainty and inconsistency. We want to tackle this uncertainty and build some method of predicting the output based on the weather.

The other problem we will be approaching is that the search space for this problem grows exponentially as more candidate locations are added to consideration. Combined with the uncertainty of how well a given allocation will perform this is not something that can easily be worked out by brute force and therefore we propose an AI based solution to these problems.

Before beginning our development we needed to research a few areas to inform our decision making. First we considered which renewable energy sources would be applicable to this sort of problem, and found that the main ones to look further into would be Wind & Solar. Each of these types of sources are impacted by different aspects of the weather, intuitively the main factors of each being Wind Speed and sunlight time as their names would suggest. Considering the both Wind & Solar we have to determine if they are both applicable to the scale we aim to achieve, in a cost perspective wind is cheaper per MW and is more commonly deployed on a large scale whereas large scale solar farms need a lot of space and are often more suitable for individuals to have installed on their property. Finally when researching the background it is important to know what standards we need to achieve to consider our project an improvement over the status quo. Within the industry of renewable energy the term 'Load Factor' refers to the percentage of its maximum capacity a generator outputs. Using this as a metric we can see that existing onshore wind turbines had a load factor of 26.5% in 2019. Setting us a target to improve upon.

From our research we determined that a focus on wind turbines would be most suitable for this project as an initial look at the feasibility and performance of our approaches. This is because at the scale we would want to propose solar energy is not all appropriately scalable due to the amount of land required to match the generation capacity of a set of large wind turbines. Another factor in our decision was that the generation of solar cells if very much strictly dependent on the amount of sunlight a quality that does not vary all that much across regions of the UK whereas factors such as wind speed and air pressure are much more variable across altitudes and locations. Furthermore this will also only consider onshore wind, as considering offshore wind would require accurate data that is much less accessible, impacting our ability to build a dataset. The last constraint we introduce is that in our allocation we will work with a predefined set of locations based upon already existing windfarms so we can remove factors such as planning permission and other associated costs & issues from our model.

We'll now briefly cover our overall approach to this project before going into more detail about each step. Firstly we will be training a regression model that will map a set of weather features to the load factor allowing us to predict the output of a location based on the weather. Next we will model the "expected weather" for each of our candidate locations, this will allow us to sample a set of 'expected days' to test the out allocations against. Then finally these previous two steps will be combined into the fitness heuristic that will inform our allocation system. This will aim to maximise a set of objectives and return us a set of results that it has deemed the most performant for review.

Before developing anything we needed to build our datasets, for our training and testing set we need two components, weather features at a point in time and then the actual amount generated by the turbine at that time as a target value. We sourced these values from reliable APIs allowing us to build a large dataset 7000+ entry dataset to test and train upon.
