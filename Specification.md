## Efficient Allocation of Renewable Energy Sources Under Uncertainty Across the UK

## Problem

AI is a very useful tool for tackling optimisation problems where the number of variables creates a number of combinations too big for any real minimisation or maximisation effort to made. As such they are the perfect tool to apply to the problem of finding an efficient way of allocating a set budget for investing in new renewable energy sources. With such a wide range of varying locations across the country  the choices of where to allocate funds quickly becomes a complicated one, especially when considering the statistically uncertain factors such as maintenance and most importantly for renewables, weather. To accurately measure and evaluate each choice we need to model the chances of different weather patters occurring throughout a set timespan and how that will effect the output of a source.
