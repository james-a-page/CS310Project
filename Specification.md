# CS310 Specification - Draft

## Efficient Allocation of Renewable Energy Sources Under Uncertainty Across the UK

## Problem

*Insert preface about environmental justification for looking into the subject* . AI is a very useful tool for tackling optimisation problems where the number of variables creates a number of combinations too big for any real minimisation or maximisation effort to made. As such it is the perfect tool to apply to finding an efficient allocation of a set budget for investing in new renewable energy sources. With such a wide range of varying locations across the country  the choices of where to allocate funds quickly becomes a complicated one, especially when considering the statistically uncertain factors such as maintenance and most importantly for renewables, weather. 

When considering a choice location and of energy source there are a range of factors to consider in evaluating the value of the decision. The costs of a choice will be impacted by the setup and connection costs, the initial production cost and the cost of repairs, meanwhile the output of a location will vary depending on the weather of any given day. This exposes the other area of the problem, the need to consider the statistical uncertainty of events such as faults requiring repair and "profitable" weather patterns occurring when evaluating a choice.

## Objectives

The main aim of this project is to create a program that can find an allocation of a variable budget that maximises the power generated by the set of chosen locations. In order to reach this aim there will be smaller incremental objectives that need to be met to build into the final working result.



## Methods



## Timetable



## Resources 

- Using python to build the "solver"
- Maybe something else required for weather modelling?

## Research Required

- Dataset of viable locations in the UK
  - Past weather information to build model to estimate power output
- Data on the costs of different renewable energy types
  - Repair and upkeep costs, and regularity of repairs needed
- Data on the power output of different energy plants, and how it varies based on weather

## Risks



## Ethical Considerations
