## Efficient Allocation of Renewable Energy Sources Under Uncertainty Across the UK

## Problem

*Insert preface about environmental justification for looking into the subject* . AI is a very useful tool for tackling optimisation problems where the number of variables creates a number of combinations too big for any real minimisation or maximisation effort to made. As such it is the perfect tool to apply to finding an efficient allocation of a set budget for investing in new renewable energy sources. With such a wide range of varying locations across the country  the choices of where to allocate funds quickly becomes a complicated one, especially when considering the statistically uncertain factors such as maintenance and most importantly for renewables, weather. 

When considering a choice location and of energy source there are a range of factors to consider in evaluating the value of the decision. The costs of a choice will be impacted by the setup and connection costs, the initial production cost and the cost of repairs, meanwhile the output of a location will vary depending on the weather of any given day. This exposes the other area of the problem, the need to consider the statistical uncertainty of events such as faults requiring repair and "profitable" weather patterns occurring when evaluating a choice.
